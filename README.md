Project developed as a course requirement for CMPT 866 â€“ Research Methods in HCI at USASK

The project is a comparative study of the effectiveness between position specific multi touch interface and a standard menu based interface in small screen touch devices. In existing mobile devices menu bars are hidden by default to maximise screen space and thus, when a user needs to perform an action they need to invoke the menu bar which is not only time consuming but disrupts user focus.

In this research an additional degree of freedom is provided using multi touch inputs relative to each finger. This will reduce the dependency on menu bars and users can carry out their work uninterrupted without the need to invoke and access menu bars.

As a part of the project participants will be asked to perform a series of tasks where they will be responding to onscreen stimuli and selecting options using both the position specific touch interface and a standard menu based interface.

The objective of the study is to compare the selection time and the error rate of both the interfaces and estimate the effectiveness of the new interface. If the new method is faster and less error prone it can be used in enhancing the interfaces of existing mobile applications and thus increase the productivity factor on small screen devices. Also with time users can develop spatial memory related to the actions and screen positions and this would lead to an improved performance.
